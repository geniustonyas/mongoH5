            </ul>
            <p class="org">In- play betting rules </p>
            <p> Live betting refers to betting on an ongoing match. Bets will be received after the event is played and all trading will be stopped after the market is closed. Individual sports will open multiple types of in-play handicap for betting. <br></p>
            <ul>
              <li> All live betting is subject to system acceptance procedures. This may result in delayed confirmation of each bet or failure of the bet. </li>
              <li> All the words "to be confirmed" on the bet slip indicate that the bet slip is waiting for the system to determine whether the bet is successful. This means that the bet is waiting to be confirmed or may be cancelled. </li>
              <li> In the event of an event or other special circumstances, all pending bets will not be confirmed and will be deemed to have been lost. This event can include goals, red cards, penalty kicks or technical problems, etc. ( Other examples are not listed in detail )<br></li>
              <li> When a major incident occurs, the Assistant TV Referee ( VAR ) will be used to determine, which may result in the cancellation of previously determined bets. The cancellation of bets starts from the beginning of major events until the final official judgment of VAR has been announced. </li>
              <li>
                In live betting, the company needs to emphasize the following terms to ensure that bets are placed at the correct time, amount and under the correct conditions :

                <ol>
                  <li>The results and goal time of the match are published on the company's website. We do not refer to any other official websites, sports websites, or " real-time scores " and other websites. </li>
                  <li>
                    If there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the bet was submitted after an event occurred during the game, the company reserves the right to cancel the bet without providing any reason or proof.
                  </li>
                  <li>In the event that the website cannot update the scores, odds or handicap, the company reserves the right to cancel all unconfirmed bets that are being processed. </li>
                </ol>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="org"> Regarding time rules </p>
            <ul>
              <li> If the game is played ahead of the statutory time, bets placed before the start of the game will still be valid, and all bets after the start of the game will be considered void ( live betting is a different matter ) . </li>
              <li> The normal end time of a football game includes stoppage time for any player injury. </li>
              <li> Unless otherwise specified in the individual sports rules, extra time points will not be counted within the normal finishing time. </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="org"> Parallel ranking rules (used in tie rules )</p>
            <ul>
              <li>If there are 2 or more winners in the handicap of an event , then the winning amount will be reduced. It is calculated by dividing the principal by the number of winners and then multiplying by the original odds. This part of the principal and profit will be returned to the member, and the remaining principal will be lost. </li>
              <li>
                For example: <br>
                <p>The first stage - you bet £ 5 at odds of 16.0 (the possible winning amount is £ 75 ) </p>
                <p>The second stage - the object you bet on and another object win at the same time </p>
                <p>The third stage - half of your principal will be multiplied by the original odds, and the rest will be lost. So 2.5 pounds multiplied by 16.0 = 37.50 pounds + 2.5 pounds returned principal is the total profit </p>
                <p> If there are more than 2 winners, the bet will be divided into corresponding equal parts </p>
                <p> In fact, in the case of 2 winners, half of the principal ( 50% ) will be multiplied by the original odds, and the remaining half ( 50% ) will be lost. </p>
              </li>
              <li>The tie rules will not apply. If we make a final decision, the ranking criteria can determine the ranking of the events. (E.g. group event) </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="org"> Venue changes </p>
            <ul>
              <li> If the venue is changed (the home and away teams are swapped), all this bets will be cancelled. </li>
              <li> The company reserves the right to cancel bets that may have an impact on the outcome of the event due to the change of the venue, for example: changing the surface of the venue for a tennis match. </li>
              <li> If the game is originally scheduled to be played in a neutral position and changed to a non-neutral position and the company determines that it will not affect the game, the bet will continue to be valid. </li>
              <li> If there are special instructions in individual sports, the above rules will be covered. </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="org"> Error </p>
            <ul>
              <li> The company strives to keep the probability of errors to a minimum, but if there is a bet that was clearly submitted when there was an error in the market, we reserve the right to cancel the bet. Errors include: </li>
              <li>
                <ol>
                  <li>The odds are wrong (significantly different from those offered on the market); </li>
                  <li> Incorrect handicap information, such as handicap number, size number, etc.; </li>
                  <li> Incorrect event information, such as team name or player, event date or start time. </li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li> If you need to cancel any bet due to the above situation, we will try our best to get in touch with the customer, and the relevant information will be published in the bulletin board in time. </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="org"> Abnormal betting behavior </p>
            <ul>
              <li> For any member who is suspected of cheating or disrupting the company's betting platform when betting, the company has the right to cancel all bets of this member and freeze the account without warning or notice. Abnormal behaviors include the use of any equipment, automatic equipment, software, programs, etc., to interfere with the operation of this website. </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="org"> Highest payout amount </p>
            <ul>
              <li>

            <p class="org"> Accept better odds </p>
            <p>
              The "term" "accepts better odds"" means that all betting slips added to this option can be automatically processed as long as the possibilities offered at the selected time show a higher return than originally shown.

                - football as an example: If you choose goals Chaoguo 2.5 Ge, and pause when the score is 2 : 1 , then your bet will be considered "won." <br>
              </li>
              <li>
                For multiple pass ( excellent odds ) , if your bet is suspended when the result is not determined, it will be considered as an invalid bet.
                - football as an example: If you choose the score was 2-2 (when the full game), and pauses when the score was 1-1 , then your bet will be considered invalid <br>
              </li>
              <li> For multiple pass ( excellent odds ) , if a single item or multiple items are tied or invalid, the odds will be readjusted. </li>

          <div class="hr-c">
            <p class="sbk-rules-title"> General rules </p>
            <p> A series of passes refers to the selection of two or more events in a single bet. Each event that chooses a series of bets must win this series of bets to be considered a winner. If the first bet wins, the winning bet will be added to the second betting option until all bets in a series of passes win or until one loses. Certain series of passes are combinations of several different series in a single series of bets. For example: 4 series of 11 is 11 different series of bets. Please refer to " serial pass bet type " selection for more information. </p>
            <p> For example: 15/12/2017</p>
            <p> Betting on a 100 yuan 3 series and 1 series to complete the following three events : </p>
            <ul>
              <li> Manchester United @ 1.80</li>
              <li> Chelsea @ 1.50 </li>
              <li> Arsenal @ 1.66 </li>
            </ul>

            <p> If all three events are won, the profit from a series of passes is 448.20 yuan (including principal). For the detailed calculation method, you can view the following information :</p>
            <ul>
              <li> Bet 1 : Manchester United 1.80*$100= $180 back . </li>
              <li> Bet 2 : Chelsea 1.50*$180= $270 returned . </li>
              <li> Bet 3 : Arsenal 1.66*$270= $448.20 returned . </li>
            </ul>

            <p> Precautions for a series of clearances :</p>
            <ul>
              <li> The maximum number of consecutive passes in a single bet of our company is 10 series. </li>
              <li> All betting events are subject to sports betting rules. </li>
              <li> Not all events can be bet on a series of passes. If you see in the betting list that it is not possible to combine two unrelated events (you can check the following information about the connected series), then one of the matches did not place a series of pass bets. </li>
              <li> A series of passes can bet on different types of events, as well as matches that are not on the same day. </li>
            </ul>

            <p> A series of options to pass the level </p>
            <p> A series of pass bets. The result of the same event or betting market that is related to the selected combination will affect another betting market. This bet is not acceptable. For example :</p>
            <p> For example : </p>
            <p>The following 2 strings of 1 are not accepted, because they are the same event : </p>
            <ul>
              <li> Manchester United won the single win handicap@1.80 </li>
              <li> Manchester United won 2-0 , the correct score handicap @7.0 </li>
            </ul>
            <p> If Manchester United win 2-0 , the combination handicap is 12.6 . In fact, the handicap should be 7.0 , because Manchester United won 2-0 , then the single-win handicap would naturally be a win. </p>
            <p> A series of pass bets, select the same team or player that is related to the combination, even if they are at different times, it is also not accepted that, for example, one result will affect another result. </p>
            <p> For example : </p>
            <ul>
              <li> Manchester United enters the Champions League final@6.0</li>
              <li> Manchester United won the Champions League @10 </li>
              <li> Combined Handicap@60.0 </li>
            </ul>
            <p> This series of passes is regarded as the second result and will affect the first result. If Manchester United win the Champions League, then Manchester United will naturally enter the Champions League final. Therefore, the handicap is only 10.0 . </p>
            <p> The company has the right to cancel a series of related pass bets. </p>

            <a name="parlaypush"></a>
            <div class="sbk-rules-title"> A series of passes </div>
            <p> In the series of passes, any betting event is invalid or tied (as in the example below), this series of over-taken orders are still valid and will be settled according to the remaining winning bets. The example is as follows: </p>
            <ul>
              <li> Bet item 1 : Chelsea ( -0.5 ) - Chelsea win. </li>
              <li> Bet item 2: Manchester ( -1 ) - Manchester United win 1-0
              </li><li> Betting item 3: Arsenal ( -0.5 ) - Arsenal win. </li>
            </ul>
            <p> Just as Manchester United won 1-0 at the ( -1 ) Asian handicap , but this event in a series of passes is regarded as a tie. Therefore, when Chelsea wins a series of Arsenal victory passes, this series of passes will be regarded as Chelsea and Arsenal's 2 series instead of the original 3 series. At the same time, the betting items for the tie will be automatically calculated as 1 . </p>
            <p> The calculation example for clearance is as follows </p>
            <p> Example 1 : One of the betting items is a sum :</p>

          <div class="hr-c">
            <p> Single win and position betting is an option consisting of two independent betting slips ( equal betting amount ) . </p>
            <ul>
              <li> If the option wins, the member will get the corresponding principal and profit of both the single win and the position. </li>
              <li> If the selected option only wins the position, the member can still get part of the principal and profit of the <strong> position </strong> . </li>
            </ul>
            <p>After confirming the bet, the bet slip will be divided into two parts: "Win" and "Position". </p>
            <p> Different items have different criteria for their "position (ranking and odds)", so the resulting profits may be different. </p>
            <p>The position item can be understood as follows: <strong>1/4</strong><strong> Odds </strong><strong>-</strong><strong> Top three </strong> . This means that if the selected object can successfully enter the top three positions, a quarter bonus of the initial odds of the betting amount of the position item (that is, half of the total betting amount) will be credited to the member's account. The standard of location will have different settings, such as <strong>1/5 – </strong><strong> before </strong><strong>5</strong><strong> name </strong> strong> or <strong> 1/5-</strong><strong> previous </strong><strong>7</strong><strong> name etc. </strong> </p>
            <p>The results of single win and position betting possibilities are as follows: </p>
            <ul type="a">
              <li> Win alone and location options will result in a win </li>
              <li>The winning option is losing, and the position option is winning </li>
              <li>The result of single win and position options are all losers </li>
            </ul>
            Please refer to the following for detailed betting results rules
            <div class="sbk-rules-title">
              <p><strong> General rules </strong><strong>:</strong></p>
            </div>
            <ul>
              <li>The single win and position options are only for some markets. The general rules of the event will also apply to this bet. </li>
              <li> The options for single win and position (position and odds) will change according to the progress of the sport. Such as: golf game. The current betting wins and position option bets will not be changed due to the future progress of the corresponding golf tournament. </li>
              <li> If the number of participants cannot meet the requirements of the single win and position options, this bet will be cancelled. For example, in the event originally scheduled for 5 participants, only 3 will participate. </li>
              <li> All contestants (teams) can bet on series (double bet, triple bet, etc.) only if they meet the options of single win and position. </li>
              <li> The series of results of the single win and position of the selected option shall be subject to "single win - single win" and "position - position", and the two cannot be mixed. For example, in the result of two series of options, only one of the "win" and "position" options wins, then in the result of this series of bets, the result of "win - win" is a loss; the result of "position - position" is a win . </li>
              <li>The multi-champion rule also applies to single wins and position betting. </li>
